          <h3>Analysis</h3>
          <p>Though there is no clear connection between latitude and wind speed, we can see that the highest of the wind speed occured in the north. 
          <br>
          <br>There are several factors that might be going into this. Perhaps this is due to there being more cities and therefore more observations in the far north compared to the far south. Maybe it has something to do with the geography of the areas or the time that the measurments were taken.

          <h3>Continuation</h3>
          <p>It would be interesting to look at other days in different seasons to see if there is a relationship with wind speed and the season. As of now it seems like there may be higher wind speeds in the winter though we don't know that for sure since there could also just be higher wind speeds in the north.  
          <br>
          <br>Though we don't see a relationship between latitude and wind speed, we could also do a regression or p-test to show that there is no statistical relation between the two.
